Live Event
---
This library holds a class to handle single live events in Android MVVM architectural pattern. This class is extended
form LiveData class, from `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-extensions` library, to propagate the data as an event,
which means it emits data just once.

Usage
---
This source has a sample app where you can find `LiveEventViewModel` in it, in which the `LiveEvent` class is used as
follows.
```kotlin
class LiveEventViewModel : ViewModel() {
    private val clickedState = LiveEvent<String>()
    val state: LiveData<String> = clickedState

    fun clicked() {
        clickedState.value = ...
    }
}
```
